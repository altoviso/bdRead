# bdRead 

bdRead is a browser-hosted API reader that's intelligent, extendable, and blazing fast. It started life as a sample
backdraft application, but proved so useful that it's been moved to a separate subproject. It is currently being used to
host the backdraft reference manual [here](http://docder.altoviso.com/docder.html?doc=/docs/com.altoviso.backdraft.api.ref.js).

See the home page for this project for further details at [bdRead home](http://bdframework.org/bdRead/index.html).
